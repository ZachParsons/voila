## Description
We're making a Rails web app for a successful magician Frederiq. It will have links to magical illusions and other magician info. The links will have headlines that are searchable. Also, the links will be tagged with names like audience participation and/or coin tricks.

A master user has access to the highly intense tricks that an apprentice wouldn't be ready for. Like, an audience member being sawed-off.

Turn your apprentice status into master.

## How to install the code locally

### Rails 5.1.1
```gem install rails```

### Ruby 2.4.1
[Install rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

Then you can install our Ruby version:
```rbenv install 2.4.1```

Follow instructions on bundling and running server for [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

## How to use the app

You can start by checking out any tags about magic that you're curious about, like card tricks. Or, if you're already a master, then you may know ... the secret code. If that's the case (wink wink), you can register as a master - not a lowly apprentice - and share your knowledge. You can share your knowledge by submitting a link to Voila.

Then all the apprentices or un-logged-in users can learn about lowly illusions you know about. But ... if you want to learn yourself - no way! You can go in the masters only area of the site to find "intense" magic illusions from your peers in the magic community.
